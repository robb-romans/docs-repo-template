API

.. Define |product name| in ``conf.py``.

Provide information about the API for the product or service. If the API is
extensive and is documented elsewhere, provide a link to it. Following is
example introductory and reference text:

The |product name| API provides developers with HTTP methods to administer
the service.

The documentation for the |product code| API is located at <URL>.

If the API is not extensive and you want to document it here, group the
methods into logical categories, using headings, and then use the `HTTP request
template <https://github.com/rackerlabs/docs-repo-template/blob/master/api-guide-template/api-reference/methods/http-request-template.rst>`_
to document the methods.
