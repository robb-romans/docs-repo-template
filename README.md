===========

This repo contains non-product-specific doc source for fragments to be included within multiple documents at http://docs.rackspace.com.

*Nothing here is meant to be publishable on its own.*

When you add a fragment, add a note in this README describing its intended use.
Add the most recent note to the top of the list.
